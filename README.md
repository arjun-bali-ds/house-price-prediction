# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices using the Ames Housing dataset. It includes EDA, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optional deployment.

## 🚀 Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and prototyping
- `src/`: Source code for data handling, training, and prediction
- `models/`: Saved trained models
- `data/`: Raw and processed data
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## ⚙️ Features

- Full pipeline from raw data to predictions
- Modular and reusable code structure
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ML model with hyperparameter tuning

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- (optional) streamlit or fastapi for deployment

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arjun-bali-ds/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
